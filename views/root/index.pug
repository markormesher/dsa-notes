			p.
				I'm (#[a(href = 'http://ormo.me') who?]) embarking on a project to brush-up, expand and hopefully master my grasp of data structures, algorithms and general coding good practises.
				This repo contains my notes, which I'm trying to create in a well-presented format that I can easily look back on.

			p I'll be adding all of my notes here; sections without a link (or with blank pages) are still on my to-do list.
